# Use of the dictionaries

My objectives are:
- to have a searchable dictionary to translate from English to another language,
- this doesn't require an internet connection,
- can be used from my smartphone.

The result is a large HTML file with a search function that allows the user to look for translation of the words given as input. The output display a list of translations and links to the associated Wiktionary pages (accessing these links requires an internet connection).

See [html/index.html](html/index.html).
