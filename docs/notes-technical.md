# "translations" box

- within section "====Translations====" (shouuld normally exists only for english words)
- one ore several "trans" blocs:
{{trans-top|**SPECIFIC MEANING**}}
...bloc content...
{{trans-bottom}}
- each entry is of the form:
* **LANGUAGE**: {{t|**LANGUAGE CODE**|translation|**optional extra info**}}
or
* **LANGUAGE**: {{t+|**LANGUAGE CODE**|translation|**optional extra info**}}
if there's several translations they are separated by coma normally (or period?)
- sometimes there are specificators for languages such as
```
* Greek:
*: Ancient: {{t|grc|ἰχνεύω}}
```
ignore those (not applicable for german i assume: **NEED TO CHECK THIS IS TRUE**)
