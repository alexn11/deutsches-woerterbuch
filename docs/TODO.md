- doublons ??? why?

- alphabetic sorting, including with diachritics

# wip

- scots

this:
    q tag with templates within: 
    `{{t+|de|Apfelsaft|m}} {{q|may be specified as {{m|de|[[tr√ºb]]er Apfelsaft}}}}, {{t+|de|Apfelmost|m}} {{q|rarer}}`

- a qualifier has `([[ambiguous]])` this link should be ignored since it's not a german word
